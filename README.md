## Learning Rust FFI

Plan is to work through:

    * Vanilla Rust <-> C interop with `std::ffi` and the core language
    * Rust <-> C interop using `bindgen and `cbindgen
    * Rust <-> C++ interop with `cxx`
    * Rust <-> Java interop with `jni`
    * Rust <-> Android interop with `ndk-context`
    * Rust <-> iOS interop with `objc`
    * Deepdive into C stdlib interop with `libc`
